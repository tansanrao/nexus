        question: "What data does Nexus index?",
        answer:
          "Nexus mirrors public-inbox repositories from lore.kernel.org, covering upstream Linux kernel mailing lists as well as subsystem lists. The mirror pipeline preserves raw mbox content so you can replay or re-export threads at any time.",
      },
      {
        question: "How fresh are the archives?",
        answer:
          "Incremental sync jobs run continuouslyâ€”grokmirror fetches new epochs, and Nexus ingests them through a streaming pipeline that de-duplicates messages, updates thread state, and refreshes search indexes. Fresh mail usually appears within minutes of hitting lore.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does search work?",
        answer:
          "Subject, full-text, and author queries are fused together. Nexus maintains PostgreSQL full-text indexes for lexical matches, pg_trgm for fuzzy subjects, and pgvector embeddings for semantic lookups. Results can be re-ranked so the most relevant mail floats to the top.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What do I need to run Nexus locally?",
        answer:
          "The reference stack uses Docker Compose with Postgres 18 (+pgvector), the Rust API server (Rocket), grokmirror, and the Next.js frontend. You can also compile the services directly; just point Nexus to a Postgres instance and a writable mirror directory.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I index private or custom archives?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Point grokmirror at any public-inbox compatible repository (local or remote) and register the list in the Nexus configuration. The importer will treat it like any lore.kernel.org source.",

    title: "Using Nexus",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Does Nexus detect patches automatically?",
        answer:
          "Every message is parsed for patch trailers, diffstats, and attachments. Nexus classifies patch series, links revisions, and highlights what changed so reviewers can skim without leaving the thread.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I follow specific authors or topics?",
        answer:
          "You can save searches, pin authors, and subscribe to threads. Nexus keeps lightweight notification cursors so you know when a tracked conversation receives new mail.",
